# How many numbers III?
#  Make a function that receives two arguments:
#
# the sum of digits value
# the amount of desired digits for the numbers
# The function should output an array with three values: [1,2,3]
#
# 1 - the total amount of all these possible numbers
#
# 2 - the minimum number
#
# 3 - the maximum numberwith
